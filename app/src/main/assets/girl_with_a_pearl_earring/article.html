<p>Did you know that the painting of The Girl with a Pearl Earring is nicknamed the Mona
    Lisa of the North? Fascinating but True! This painting is beginning to rival Mona Lisa in
    terms of exposure. This is mainly happening because of modern day alterations of this
    painting. This painting is o beautiful. I think the most beautiful things about this painting is
    that the bright yellow of the headscarf and the amazingly painted pearl created by a quick
    and elegant few strokes. Also, the shades of blue that are like water in her eyes. Her skin is
    also a beauty of the picture and elegant white stands out in the black background. The
    mystery of the painting is also very huge and people would say it is a quality of the
    painting itself. We donâ€™t know what the girl is thinking while she is in the pose for the
    painting. Also we know very little of Johannes himself. We do know his other 35
    paintings. Over all The Girl with a Pearl Earring is definitely a masterpiece.</p>
