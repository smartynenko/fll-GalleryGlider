<p>LOne of the most immediately recognized artworks, the <b>Japanese wave painting <i>Under The Great Wave off Kanagawa</i></b> has been shaking up the art world for <b>two centuries</b> and continues to stay in the center of focus of contemporary visual arts and design.</p>
<p>It was created by <b>Hokusai Katsushika</b>, one of the greatest Japanese painters and printmakers of the 19th century, as a part of his series titled <i>36 famous views of Mount Fuji</i>, <b>
    a sacred mountain</b> in <b>Japan</b>. The print was initially created by Hokusai around 1830, but the publishing date is 1832. It is created as a woodblock print, using the
    traditional Japanese <b>ukiyo-e</b> technique.</p>
<p>The work itself speaks a lot about <b>the position of Japan during times of isolation</b>,
    as well as the <b>influence of Western ideas</b> on the development of a traditional Japanese
    society and its philosophy. Even though Japan opened its ports for foreign visitors only in <b>1859</b>,
    this work contained usage of a distinctive and special European color, <b>the Prussian blue</b>,
    which means that some kind of <b>cultural exchange existed even during the 1830s</b>. After
    opening the ports, this work quickly became famous and <b>exported to Europe and America</b>,
    where it was celebrated by famous artists like <b><i>Van Gogh</i>, <i>Whistler</i> <i>and</i> <i>Monet</i></b>.
    It even influenced <b>Debussy's symphonic sketches</b> titled <i>La Mer</i>.</p>
<p>Besides being popular during Modernism, this artwork still influences many contemporary artists
    and designers, where it became something like a brand, a work famous for being famous,
    immediately recognized and celebrated, sometimes possibly without even questioning the reason
    for it. It also influenced many <b>street artists</b> who paint the walls of the entire planet with
    this well-known image.</p>
