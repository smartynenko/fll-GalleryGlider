<h2>When Was Water Lilies Made</h2>
<p>“One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all,” said Claude Monet, referring to his late masterpieces, the water landscapes he produced at his home in Giverny between 1897 and his death in 1926. These works replaced the varied contemporary subjects he had painted from the 1870s through the 1890s with a single, timeless motif—water lilies.</p>
<h2>How Was It Made</h2>
<p>The focal point of these paintings was the artist’s beloved flower garden, which featured a water garden and a smaller pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. In his first water-lily series (1897–99), Monet painted the pond environment, with its plants, bridge, and trees neatly divided by a fixed horizon.</p>
<h2>Why Did It Famous </h2>
<p>Over time, the artist became less concerned with conventional pictorial space. By the time he painted "Water Lilies," which comes from his third group of these works, he had dispensed with the horizon line altogether. In this spatially ambiguous canvas, the artist looked down, focusing solely on the surface of the pond with its cluster of vegetation floating amid the reflection of sky and trees. Monet thus created the image of a horizontal surface on a vertical one. This painting is located multiple places, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Orangerie Museum, Museum of Modern Art, & many more.</p>
