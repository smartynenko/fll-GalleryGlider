<p>Welcome to Gallery Glider, the innovative brainchild of Team Tech Lightning 38273, a group of enthusiastic students who share a deep love for both art and technology. As part of this year's Master Piece season challenge, which posed the question, "How can you use technology and the arts to help engage others?", we found our answer.​Born from our combined passions and a desire to make art more accessible, Gallery Glider is our way of bringing the world's artistic treasures to your doorstep. We believe that art shouldn't be bound by physical barriers - it's a universal language that everyone should have the chance to speak and understand. Our mission is to open up the realms of art to all, using innovative technology to create an engaging, interactive experience.​Through Gallery Glider, we're not just showcasing art; we're building bridges between different cultures, eras, and people. Join us on this exciting journey where we explore the beauty of art, the power of technology, and the magic that happens when they come together. Let's glide through galleries around the world, right from where you are!</p>
