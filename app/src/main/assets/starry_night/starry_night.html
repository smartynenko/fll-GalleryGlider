<h2>A Unique Masterpiece</h2>
<p>&quot;The Starry Night&quot; is a very famous painting by Vincent van Gogh, a great artist. This painting is special
because van Gogh usually painted things like flowers and fields, but here, he painted a night scene with
hills, a sky full of stars, and big, fiery-looking trees. People remember this painting for its bright blue and
yellow colors and the thick, wavy lines.</p>
<h2>What Van Gogh Thought</h2>
<p>Van Gogh called this painting a &quot;study of night&quot; or a &quot;night effect&quot; in his letters. His brother Theo, who
knew a lot about art, wasn&#39;t very impressed at first. He thought van Gogh focused too much on the style
and not enough on the real feelings of the scene.</p>
<h2>How Van Gogh Made It</h2>
<p>Van Gogh had been thinking about painting a Starry Night for a long time. It was hard to paint this scene
because he liked painting what he saw in front of him, not just from his imagination. He first tried

painting a night scene called &quot;Starry Night over the Rhône&quot; outside in the city of Arles, using gas lights to
see. But &quot;The Starry Night&quot; we know was mostly made indoors, in a studio.</p>

<h2>Where Van Gogh Was</h2>
<p>Van Gogh painted "The Starry Night" while he was staying in an asylum near Saint-Rémy after a difficult time in his life. He was encouraged to paint there. He had a view of mountains and a garden, and he used these views, along with memories and imagination, to create the painting.</p>
<h2>What Makes It Special</h2>
<p>The painting shows Van Gogh's creative style. He was inspired by medieval woodcuts, which have simple shapes and thick lines. The colors he used for the night sky and stars were not just black and white. He saw many colors in the night, like violet, blue, green, and even lemon and pink in the stars.</p>

<h2> Our Thoughts About This Painting</h2>
<p>Our team observes that this painting has unique textures. Also, the focal point of the starry night, is the sky. The vibrant colors around the stars and especially the vibrant moon really catches your eye. The tower in the front of the painting catches your eye and it is like a tree tower from the fantasy world.</p>
