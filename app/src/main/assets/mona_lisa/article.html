<p>Lots of artists were inspired by the painting of Mona Lisa. They describe it as a root to the Italian
    Renaissance paintings (1700s-1900s). In this painting Leonardo used and perfected the traditional
    technique of Florentine. It is called sfumato in Italian. Which literally means vanished or evaporated.
    Leonardo used it perfectly in the background. It also states that his brush strokes were so subtle that to the
    naked eye it could be invisible. Even Leonardo was impressed about the way light fell on the curves of his
    painting and how that looked very cool. Leonardo created a gauzy veil using paint and made Mona Lisa’s
    face to give a glow and be very bright. Today’s art critics call attention to the painting’s mystery and
    harmony. In the old days, though, art critics call the attention to the striking realisticness in the paintings.
    According to pbs.org, “The realism of his painting is a result of Leonardo's diverse scientific observations.
    From the study of human anatomy he developed a mathematical system for determining size in space,
    perspective that is incorporated in the way Mona Lisa's torso, head and eyes are each turned a little more
    toward the viewer.” Leonardo also took the study of science very seriously in his paintings and applied it very
    seriously to this painting.</p>
