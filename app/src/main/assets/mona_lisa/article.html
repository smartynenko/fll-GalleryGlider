<p>Many artists have been inspired by Leonardo da Vinci's painting, the Mona Lisa. They often describe it as foundational to Italian Renaissance paintings, which flourished between the 1700s and 1900s. In this masterpiece, Leonardo utilized and perfected the traditional technique known as Florentine. In Italian, it’s called 'sfumato,' meaning 'vanished' or 'evaporated.' He applied this technique masterfully, especially in the background.</p>

<p>It’s said that Leonardo's brush strokes were so delicate they could be almost invisible to the naked eye. Even Leonardo himself was fascinated by how light played on the curves in his painting, creating a very cool effect. He painted a gauzy veil over Mona Lisa’s face, giving her a bright, glowing appearance. Today, art critics often focus on the painting's mysterious and harmonious qualities. In contrast, critics in the past were struck by its realistic portrayal.</p>

<p>According to pbs.org, the realism in Leonardo's work comes from his diverse scientific observations. From studying human anatomy, he developed a mathematical system for sizing objects in space - a technique called perspective. This is evident in how Mona Lisa's torso, head, and eyes each turn slightly more toward the viewer. Leonardo took his studies in science very seriously and applied this knowledge meticulously to his paintings, particularly in the Mona Lisa.</p>
