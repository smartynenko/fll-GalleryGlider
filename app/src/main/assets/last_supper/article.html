<h1>The Last Supper by Leonardo da Vinci</h1>

<p>First things first can you believe that Leonardo apparently invented a new method to finish
    the painting. This painting is not a fresco. He had to finish it very quickly so he used
    tempera paint. Fun fact, tempera paint is mixed with eggs. Leonardoâ€™s painting nailed the
    perspective element in art. This would be great painting for art teachers to point out when
    they point out the perspective element in their class. I also want to point out that not only
    was this a painting it was also math as well. There is a math formula used in this painting.
    The math formula is called The Golden Ratio. The Golden Ratio is when you divide a
    rectangle into a square and a rectangle that are both in proportion. Lots of people claim
    that Leonardo used faces that he knew in the painting. Some say he even used his own face
    in this painting.</p>
